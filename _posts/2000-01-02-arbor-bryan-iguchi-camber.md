Quick Points:

- Tight control, reliable design.
- Easy turns - holds an edge nicely.
- Hefty and slightly stiff for stability.

This solid board is the top choice out of hundreds of models, and for good reason.

Bryan Iguchi is one of the most respected snowboarders in the world, and he knows what makes for a good ride.

The subtle nose and tail, combined with the slight tapering, give the board an easy, forgiving, and controlled ride. You can very easily maneuver your way around the mountain, and it gives you a sense of power unlike anything else on this list.

The board is a little bit stiffer than some of the other options, and a few riders were less impressed with how heavy it is, but if you want to enjoy a tight, reliable ride, this is the board for you.

Arbor’s “Grip Tech” seemed almost like a gimmick, but I have to admit that I was surprised at just how much control there was in the turns. Holding an edge was no problem.

If you’re not familiar with ‘Guch, he’s a free ride pro, and this board is designed for just that.

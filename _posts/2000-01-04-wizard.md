Quick Points:

- Playful, buttery board.
- Feels versatile, but definitely built for parks.
- Awesome value for the money.

A lot of snowboards are designed really well, with premium materials, but they just aren’t *fun*.

The Wizard Stick fixes that.

This board does just about everything with equal grace. It feels fairly traditional, but that doesn’t mean it’s boring: it gives you a lot of precision, and it’s damn fun to ride.

It’s a true twin, but it has inserts that are set back, which I really appreciated on fresh snow.

You can take this out of the park, no doubt, and the design helps make it a versatile board, but it really shines in the park.

The Wizard Stick is one of the newer boards on this list, and I think that might explain why such a great board is coming in at just around $400. My guess is that once people realize what this thing can do, the future models will be priced a bit higher, so you might want to grab this one before 2020.

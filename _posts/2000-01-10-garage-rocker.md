Quick Points:

- Low cost, but not “cheap.”
- Agile with a nice snap.
- Respectable board under $300.

You’re never going to get a snowboard as nice as the Wizard Stick for under $300, but the Rome Garage Rocker is the perfect choice for anyone who wants a decent board at a low price.

Considering the cost of renting all the equipment you need, you’ll get your money’s worth from buying this board in about five or six trips, so economically speaking, it just makes sense to invest in your own board.

But that doesn’t mean you want to go *too* cheap.

The Rome Garage Rocker is a respectable board. It’s a great all-mountain snowboard, but it’s a bit softer than you might expect, so you can take it to the park without getting weighed down.

It’s a true twin, it feels agile, and the Bambooster gives you a nice snap.

Overall, it’s a fun, agile board, and at this price, it’s the best option for someone who wants to save money without ending up on something cheap.

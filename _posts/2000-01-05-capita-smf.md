Quick Points:

- Versatile - great for parks and mountains.
- Flat center, rocker in the tip and tail.
- Fun, flexible, and snappy.

The Space Metal Fantasy is a nicely priced board that delivers excellent value.

It feels very forgiving, which helps when you’re trying to master a new grab or pushing yourself to the limit.

The Space Metal Fantasy isn’t exactly a secret. It’s won a lot of awards for being a low-cost, fun, snappy board.

But if you haven’t tried one yourself, you might not realize just how good it is. The board is stable, even at high speeds, and it gives you a sense of control that almost feels like magic. There were a few times I looked behind me at some of the terrain I flew through, and I couldn’t believe how easy it felt to zip in and out.

The Space Metal Fantasy is durable and strong, and it’s designed to take rails like a champ. It’s a low-maintenance, very smooth board that’s easy to own (and easy to ride).

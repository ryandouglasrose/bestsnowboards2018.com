Quick Points:

- Handles beautifully in fresh, fluffy snow.
- Incredible all-mountain board that still works well switch.
- Good flex, but still sturdy enough for rugged terrain.

Annie Boulanger is a fan of the Pillow Talk, and it takes about two minutes to find out why.

(If you’re worried that Annie’s just in it for the sponsorship money, don’t be: plenty of pros have fallen in love with this board, with or without the royalty check.)

It easily snaps into a turn, so venturing between trees on a powder day is no problem. You really get to enjoy the adventure of backcountry snowboarding.

Plus, it’s light enough to switch almost instantly, but you still get a good sense of stability and control. Although I usually prefer a heavier board, something about the design here helps make it feel sturdy and rugged.

I wouldn’t give this board to a total rookie, but any ladies with a few trips under their belt will be able to control and enjoy the Pillow Talk with ease. It’s a super fun board for any mountain.

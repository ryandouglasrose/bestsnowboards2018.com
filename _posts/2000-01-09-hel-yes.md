Quick Points:

- Lives up to its name - it’s fun as hell.
- Snappy bamboo core really pops.
- Easy to maneuver.
- Edge control was tight.

This all-mountain board is fun to ride, period.

The bamboo core gives it a good snap, and it feels lively and agile when you’re taking a turn. The edge control was tight and predictable, giving me a sense of domination over the mountain.

Feeling like you’re in control and knowing what the board’s going to do is great, especially when you’re hitting some patchy terrain. Everything about this ride is responsive.

The Yes. Hel Yes is a bit more flexible than some other boards, but it doesn’t feel flimsy at all. I felt really connected to the snow, which just goes back to that responsive, fun, controlled ride.

It floats well. The turns are tight. There’s a lot of camber between your feet, and everything about the Hel Yes is fun.

Oh, and it’s crazy fast.

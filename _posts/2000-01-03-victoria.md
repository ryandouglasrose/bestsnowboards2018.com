Quick Points:

- Fast and stiff - a serious ride.
- Amazing free ride potential.
- Lightweight with good snap.
- Meant for serious female snowboarders.

Women’s snowboards have a bad reputation for underestimating their customers. The Nitro Victoria doesn’t make that mistake.

What separates the Victoria from most other women’s boards is that it’s a great snowboard first, and a women’s board second. It doesn’t assume that you can’t handle a stiff, respectable board.

If you’ve ever tried a “girly” snowboard that just has a weak ride with a pink design, you know what I’m talking about.

This directional board is amazing for free riding down a diverse mountain. You can easily take it down just about any slope you’ll find, and you’ll always have the control you want.

And by the way, this board is *fast*.

The Nitro Victoria is one of very few women’s snowboards that isn’t essentially condescending. It’s designed for incredible speed and it goes just as fast as any men’s board made by Nitro, so you won’t be dragging behind the dudes because of your snowboard.

Show up with this board, and you’re guaranteed to stay in the front of the pack.

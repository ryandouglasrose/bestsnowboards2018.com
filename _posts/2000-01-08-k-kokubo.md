Quick Points:

- High rating among pros.
- Practically perfect, balanced design.
- Huge stepdowns and adventurous heights smoothly.

The Kazu Kokubo Pro is a balanced board all around. There’s just the right amount of flex for control and stability.

Kazu Kokubo is one of those really adventurous riders who loves taking on backcountry powder, and this board helps you do just that. Landing from a massive drop, I immediately got control and could manage a sharp turn right away.

Simply put, this board is fun.

It’s a great blend of freeride and freestyle, so you can take it just about anywhere, and you’ll always have the same sense of control. It’s almost perfect, and I can’t think of anything I would change.

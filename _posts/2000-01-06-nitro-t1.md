Quick Points:

- Great pop from a medium-flex board.
- Lightweight, good control.
- Classic, no-nonsense park board.

You have to be careful when taking product advice from a pro. Just because it works well for someone with twenty years of experience doesn’t mean it’ll work out for someone who just takes a few casual trips.

The Nitro T1 is great because pros love it, but it’s easy to control and it works well for anyone at any skill level.

You don’t have to be pro to handle it, and more importantly, you don’t have to be doing anything crazy to enjoy riding it.

It’s easy to control, and the medium level of flex really gives it a fun pop that still feels sturdy enough to take down a pipe. It won’t transfer as well to freeriding as the Wizard Stick, but for true park snowboarders, it’s a solid choice.

Overall, the Nitro T1 is a fun, poppy park board that’s well priced.
